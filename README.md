## [HKUST DS CoLab](https://library.hkust.edu.hk/ds/ds-colab/) Intern: AR for Ancient Maps (Ongoing)
- We are animating some selected ancient maps from the [Library's Special Collections](https://lbezone.hkust.edu.hk/rse/) into 2D/3D illustrations and applying AR technology to develop an interactive platform for them.
- My main contributions: 
  - Developing the interactive platform using [Mind-AR.js](https://github.com/hiukim/mind-ar-js).


## [HKUST DS CoLab](https://library.hkust.edu.hk/ds/ds-colab/) Intern: Topic Modelling Web Tool (EN Version)
- We developed a topic modelling tool with an English and a Chinese versions for non-technical users.
- My main contributions:
  - Developed the English version.
  - Main designer of the functionalities.
- Presentation proposal accepted to [Global Digital Humanities Symposium 2025](https://msuglobaldh.org/)! Here is our proposal: [proposal](https://msuglobaldh.org/abstracts#yip-wang)
